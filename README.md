This is an archive of some of my code from this past summer. I've been meaning to properly clone my repo's from Google Earth Engine and Google Collab, but this will have do for now. CSV files for PSUs/SSUs are from July. Currently working on updating them with GLOBE/CEO/AOI obsevations from late july, August, and early September.
