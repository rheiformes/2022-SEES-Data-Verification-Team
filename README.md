# 2022-SEES-Data-Verification-Team (Rhea Rai, Rebecca Lawton, Anahid Vicente)
This is an archive of some of our code from this past summer. I've been meaning to properly clone the repo's from Google Earth Engine and Google Collab, but this will have to do for now. CSV files for PSUs/SSUs are from July. Currently working on updating them with GLOBE/CEO/AOI observations from late july, August, and early September.
